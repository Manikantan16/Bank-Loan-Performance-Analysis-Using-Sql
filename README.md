# Bank-Loan-Performance-Analysis-Using-Sql
- This project focuses on Bank Loan Performance Analysis using SQL, targeting key financial and operational metrics.
- This project utilizes SQL Server to perform in-depth analysis of bank loan data, focusing on efficient data extraction, transformation, and querying.
- It tracks Total Loan Applications, Month-to-Date (MTD) Applications, Funded and Received Amounts, Average Interest Rate, and Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio.
- By leveraging SQL queries on loan databases, the analysis provides a Monthly Loan Application Summary, enabling insights into lending trends, customer behavior, and 
  financial health.
- Aggregations, filters, and date functions are used to monitor performance over time, helping stakeholders assess loan quality and risk.
- The project supports data-driven decision-making for loan strategy optimization and improved credit risk management in banking operations.
## Tools Used: ‚öôÔ∏èüñ•Ô∏è
- SQL Server Management Studio V20.2.1
## Dataset:üìäüìÅ
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from a CSV file that contains detailed loan application data. It is imported into MS SQL Server for querying and 
 analysis.
- Steps to import the CSV Data:
   - Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and click connect

   - Preview Data -> Click Next
   - Modify Columns If Required ->Click Next (In my case I assigned **Primary Key** to **Id** Column, **Emp_title** column increased column size to **nvarchar(150).**
   - Click Next again, and finally, click Finish to complete the Import.
   - A New Table is now successfully created in the database.

## Dashboard 1: Summary
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:**
- **Total Loan Applications:** Calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period, including Month-to-Date (MTD) and Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.

- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI):** Evaluate the average DTI for borrowers, compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track MoM fluctuations.

- **Good Loan Vs Bad Loan**:
  - Key metrics such as Loan Issuance Percentage, Number of Loan Applications, Funded Amount, and Repayment Received are evaluated across both Good and Bad loan 
   categories to provide a comprehensive view of loan performance

## Conclusion
The project will demonstrate how SQL Server can serve as a powerful platform for storing, querying, and analyzing bank loan data. It will help decision-makers monitor loan performance and optimize risk management practices based on reliable data insights.

Also I‚Äôd like to thank my friend **Sunitha Mekala** üë´üôè for being an incredible source of inspiration.
