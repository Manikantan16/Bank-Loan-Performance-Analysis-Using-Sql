# Bank-Loan-Performance-Analysis-Using-Sql
- This project focuses on bank loan performance analysis using SQL, targeting key financial and operational metrics.
- It tracks Total Loan Applications, Month-to-Date (MTD) Applications, Funded and Received Amounts, Average Interest Rate, and Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio.
- By leveraging SQL queries on loan databases, the analysis provides a Monthly Loan Application Summary, enabling insights into lending trends, customer behavior, and 
  financial health. Aggregations, filters, and date functions are used to monitor performance over time, helping stakeholders assess loan quality and risk. The project supports data-driven decision-making for loan strategy optimization and improved credit risk management in banking operations.
